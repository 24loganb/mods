# DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS:

#1. Go to https://fabricmc.net/use/ and download a version of fabric, however make sure it is 1.16.2. Currently this is the only version of this modpack that is supported and
#of the moment there are NO PLANS TO UPDATE TO LATER VERSIONS. There is an automatic mod updater within the pack, however not all mods are supported.

#2. Download the mods folder and place it inside .minecraft -- (to navigate here press Win+R > type %appdata% > click on .minecraft > place mods folder inside .minecraft

#3. Open up the Minecraft Launcher then click Installations > Click on New > Click the drop down underneath Version and select the version of Fabric we just installed

#4. IMPORTANT STEP: WHILE STILL IN THE CREATE NEW INSTALLATION SECTION CLICK ON THE MORE OPTIONS DROP DOWN > UNDERNEATH JVM ARGUMENTS CHANGE Xmx2G TO AT LEAST Xmx5G. THIS WILL
#ALLOCATE MORE RAM TO THIS VERSION OF MINECRAFT AND PREVENT THE GAME FROM CRASHING DUE TO INSUFFICENT MEMORY.

#5. Click Create > Play > Click the drop down on the lower left of screen and select that newly created installation. After this you can click play. If there is an error
#message upon launch simply remove the mod that it says is causing issues. (sometimes the game will fail to show the error message and to find out what the fatal mod is
#simply change the option in the launcher's settings to show console while the game launches and you should be able to find the fatal error quite easily).
